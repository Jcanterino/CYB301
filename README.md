# CYB301
Cybersecurity tool development for CYB301(Cybersecurity Fundamentals)

My current plan is to make a password managing software.
My main fear with using password managers online is that the passwords are stored in a server and not locally.
By creating my own password manager all the passwords can be saved and encrypted locally instead.
I plan to program in python because it's a simple option for what I'm looking to do
